# Ranked_MSD

## A New Feature Ranking and Feature Selection Approach

#### Research Question: Can we identify a reasonably small subset of important genes for a particular disease by analysing gene expression profiles without losing disease prediction accuracy?

#### Algorithm 1. Ranked_MSD_F_Best: This algorithm can rank all the features based on their importance score and select a small subset of features that can give best accuracy without losing disease prediciton accuray.

#### Algorithm 2. Ranked_MSD_F_Equal: This algorithm can rank all the features based on their importance score and select a small subset of features that can give accuracy equal to the full feature set.

The uploaded codes demonstrate the algorithms performance using k-NN classifier. Proposed algorithms can be tested using any machine learning classifier. Just change KNN training code to any other classifier that you want to use.
